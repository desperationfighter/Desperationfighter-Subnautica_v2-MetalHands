# Desperationfighter-Subnautica_v2-MetalHands

This Mod is the Updates Version supporting Subnautica v2.x and Nautilus. If you use Legency (with QMM and SML) then please use my old Mod.

***

This Mod adds a new Gloves with a feature to instandly break Ressouces.
In the next Tier it collect the broken Items directly into the Inventory.
There are Gloves for the Player that enables this feature.
Also there is a Module that upgrades the Prawn Claw into a Gravitation Claw and Autocollect broken items too.

You can find the Blueprints randomly on Databoxes. (WARNING for v2.0.0.0: Feature currently disabled. I am waiting for the Author of Databoxes Mod to update the Mod)

At least... You bored and don't want my shitty Gloves ? No Problem ! You can activate the Cheat mode and use my Mod without the need to craft the
Glove.

Warning:
This Mod currently not properly working with the "Increased Chunk Drop Mod".
It collect the vanilla item but not the additional spawned ones.

How to config this Mod ?
Simply look under Settings -> Mods
There you will find all available Configs.

(not recommend) if you want to change something outside the game. Look into the "config.json" that is located in the BepInEx Config Folder.

Best Practise to use
The Custom Databoxes will only spawn in not discovered Areas.
So i recommen to use the Mod on new Savefile.
If you have already discovered the hole Map you need to unlock them via Console. (Or spawn it. For Techtype Name scoll down to "Spoiler")
